# "Bean Builder" for Atom Editor

The "Bean Builder" is an [Atom](https://atom.io/) package that allows you to build Arduino sketches for the [LightBlue Bean](https://punchthrough.com/bean/) and upload them to the [Bean Loader application](https://punchthrough.com/bean/guides/getting-started/os-x/).

### Motivation

The LightBlue Bean ecosystem makes the barrier to entry for "embedded" development very low. In no time at all you can be writing sketches for the Bean using the Arduino IDE and the Bean Loader application. However, before long you may find yourself desiring a more rich editor/IDE such as Atom. Arduino allows you to do use external editors but it introduces yet another application to the mix because the Arduino IDE is still required for compiling sketches. This package eliminates the need for the Arduino IDE and lets you compile sketches straight from Atom and sends the compiled sketch to the Bean Loader, just like Arduino does.
